{"query": "How do you create a run?", "context": "AML API only", "response": "To create a run using the Azure Machine Learning API, you first need to create an Experiment. Once you have an experiment, you can create a Run object that is associated with that experiment. Here is some Python code that demonstrates this process:\n\nfrom azureml.core import Experiment, Run\nfrom azureml.core.workspace import Workspace\n\n# Define workspace and experiment\nws = Workspace.from_config()\nexp = Experiment(workspace=ws, name='my_experiment')\n\n# Create a new run\nrun = exp.start_logging()\n\nIn this code, the `from_config()` method reads the configuration file that you created when you set up your Azure Machine Learning workspace. The `Experiment` constructor creates an Experiment object that is associated with your workspace, and the `start_logging()` method creates a new Run object that is associated with the Experiment. Now you can use the `run` object to log metrics, upload files, and track other information related to your machine learning experiment.", "ground_truth": "To create a run in Azure ML, create an Experiment and call start_logging()."}
{"query": "How do you log a model?", "context": "Logging can be done using any OSS Sdk", "response": "There are a few ways to log models in Azure Machine Learning. One way is to use the `register_model()` method of the `Run` object. The `register_model()` method logs a model file in the Azure Machine Learning service workspace and makes it available for deployment. Here's an example:\nfrom azureml.core import Model\nmodel_path = './outputs/my_model.pkl'\nmodel = Model.register(workspace=ws, model_path=model_path, model_name='my_model')\nAnother way to log a model is to save it as an output of a `Run`. If your model generation code is part of a script or Jupyter notebook that runs as an Azure Machine Learning experiment, you can save the model file as an output of the `Run` object.\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom azureml.core.run import Run\nrun = Run.get_context()\nX_train, y_train = ...\nlog_reg = LogisticRegression().fit(X_train, y_train)\nmodel_path = 'outputs/model.pkl'\njoblib.dump(value=log_reg, filename=model_path)\nrun.upload_file(name=model_path, path_or_stream=model_path)", "ground_truth": "Use Model.register() or Run.upload_file() to log models in Azure ML."}
